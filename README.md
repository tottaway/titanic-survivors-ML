# Exploring Machine Learning
This is an exploration of adapting the techniques taught in Andrew NG's Coursera course on machine learning to kaggle's begginer competition dataset. I reached, by best estimates, ~80% accuracy, however, it then backslid to ~75%. The performance of my model is nothing to brag about, however, I do feel that I did learn a good deal, and cemented the knowlege I had gained through the Coursera course.

In the future, if I do return to this project I would like to explore more techniques surrounding data processing of which I did very little (ex. taking educated guesses to fill in missing data, encoding more of the people's personla information into information which the model could train on)
